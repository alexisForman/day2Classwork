This assignment was difficult for me. I understood the forloops, and I thought I understood how to create an element and make something appear in it using java dom, but everytime I tried to make a <div><ul><li></li></ul></div> I couldnt get the additional food items to line up into it. I intend to come back to this on later when I know more and hopefully get it done right, how I want it.
